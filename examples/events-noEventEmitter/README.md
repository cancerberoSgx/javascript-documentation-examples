All of this was a failure since I couldn't make what I wanted, but teach me a lot about the tools limitations. If you want to go to the successful experiment where I now now to to do it properly go to [this example](https://cancerberosgx.github.io/javascript-documentation-examples/examples/events-002/docs/docco/src/index.html) 

 * This is an example similar to [events-001](https://cancerberosgx.github.io/javascript-documentation-examples/examples/events-001/docs/docco/src/index.html) but using a rich event - listeners, class inheritance hierarchy that's completly unrelated with `EventEmitter`. 
 
 * I dont think this particular example gives much information.
