# TypeDoc Tutorial

In this tutorial you will learn how to document your [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
projects using [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/), a tool that will extract descriptions from your TypeScript 
source comments and generate a well organized and pretty HTML documentation. 

It is required that you know the basics of TypeScript, but besides that, this tutorial will start from scratch.

## TypeDoc Introduction

TypeDoc is an API documentation generator for TypeScript projects, similar 
to [jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) or [javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc).

Basically, you add documentation comments directly to your source code, right alongside the code 
itself. The TypeDoc tool will scan your source code and generate an HTML documentation website for you.
  
Although configurable, TypeDoc will generate documentation of everything in your source, 
even things that are not documented. 

For adding descriptions of some entity in the code you must use special comments that must be placed 
immediately *before* the code being documented. Each comment must start with a `/**` sequence in order 
to be recognized by TypeDoc. Comments beginning with `//`, `/*`, `/***`, or more than 3 stars will be ignored. 

The simplest documentation is just a description:


{{/text}}{{#code link="classes/fruit"}}
/** This is a description of the class Fruit */
class Fruit {

}
{{/code}}{{#text}}

## Classes and Interfaces

### Classes vs. interfaces

First of all, if you are working with interfaces and you intention is that your users work with them and hide the implementation details, then you **should only document** interfaces and never worry about documenting classes. Document classes only to give details about the implementation, if that's what you want, but make sure don't repeat information that's already in the interface.


{{/text}}{{#code}}
/**
 * A shape is the form of an object or its external boundary, outline
 * @param U The unit used to measure the properties of this type of shape
 */
interface Shape<U extends Unit > {
  area():number;
}
interface Unit {}
interface Centimeter extends Unit {} 
/**
 * The Shape implementation used in Foo component to represent Bar
 */
class MyCustomRectangle implements Shape<Centimeter> {
  private side:number;
  public area():number {
    return this.side*this.side;
  }
}
{{/code}}{{#text}}

This is the output of the interface: {{link url="interfaces/shape"}} and this is the output of the class: {{link url="classes/mycustomrectangle"}}

### Generic types

TODO: you can se in the previous example



TypeDoc will document the classes for you
 * say that if you are working with interfaces, then you want to document interfaces instead of classes

TODO



{{/text}}{{#text}}
## Properties






{{/text}}{{#text}}
## Methods and Functions

TODO
 * overrides and how they look
 * generic types

### Constructors

constructors can be documented just like any other method








{{/text}}{{#text}}
## Referencing

When we are describing an entity sometimes we want to reference another entity. For example, I'm describing the method `Wind.blow()` and in its description I want to talk about the class `Ocean`. I want that a link to that class appear in that descriptions so readers can jump there with just a click and not having to search for `Ocean` manually. That's what we call referencing. 

With TypeDoc is very easy to archieve That TODO


 TODO : relative - vs - absolteuse absolute names - careful with repeated names.

## Ignoring things


If we don't want some class method or other entity to appear at all in TypeDoc output we use the `@hidden` tag. 

**Important**: Put `@hidden` at the very top of the comment related to the entity you want to ignore. 

You can ignore any entity that can be documented with its own comment, for example classes, methods, properties, etc. But you can't ignore parameters or return values because these doesn't have its own comment. 

In the following example, the output will only contain `method2()` but not `method1()``: 

{{/text}}{{#code link="interfaces/somethingsareignored"}}
interface SomeThingsAreIgnored {
  /**
   * @hidden
   * this comment should be ignored
   * 
   */
  method1():Promise<void>;
  /**
   * this comment shouldn't be ignored
   */
  method2():string;
}
{{/code}}{{#text}}

The following example makes TypeDoc to ignore the whole class: 

{{/text}}{{#code link="classes/classtotallyignored"}}
/** @hidden */
export class ClassTotallyIgnored {
  color:string;
}
{{/code}}{{#text}}


### Filter non public or non exported entities globally

You can also configure TypeDoc tool to ignore all entities that are not public or all entities that are not exported. For that you must use the configuration options: 
```
 --exclude                 Define patterns for excluded files when specifying paths.
 --excludeExternals        Prevent externally resolved TypeScript files from being documented.
 --excludeNotExported      Prevent symbols that are not exported from being documented.
 --excludePrivate          Ignores private variables and methods
 --excludeProtected
```
