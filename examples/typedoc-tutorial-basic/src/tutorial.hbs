# TypeDoc Tutorial

In this tutorial you will learn how to document your [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
projects using [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/), a tool that will extract descriptions from your TypeScript 
source comments and generate a well organized and pretty HTML documentation. 

It is required that you know the basics of TypeScript, but besides that, this tutorial will start from scratch.

## TypeDoc Introduction

TypeDoc is an API documentation generator for TypeScript projects, similar 
to [jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) or [javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc).

Basically, you add documentation comments directly to your source code, right alongside the code 
itself. The TypeDoc tool will scan your source code and generate an HTML documentation website for you.
  
Although configurable, TypeDoc will generate documentation of everything in your source, 
even things that are not documented. 

For adding descriptions of some entity in the code you must use special comments that must be placed 
immediately *before* the code being documented. Each comment must start with a `/**` sequence in order 
to be recognized by TypeDoc. Comments beginning with `//`, `/*`, `/***`, or more than 3 stars will be ignored. 

The simplest documentation is just a description:


{{/text}}{{#code link="classes/fruit.html"}}
/** This is a description of the class Fruit */
class Fruit {

}
{{/code}}{{#text}}

## Classes and Interfaces

 * say that if you are working with interfaces, then you want to document interfaces instead of classes

## Ignoring things

If we don't want some class method or other entity to appear at all in TypeDoc output we use the `@hidden` tag. 

**Important**: Put `@hidden` at the very top of the comment related to the entity you want to ignore. 

You can ignore any entity that can be documented with its own comment, for example classes, methods, properties, etc. But you can't ignore parameters or return values because these doesn't have its own comment. 

In the following example, the output will only contain `method2()` but not `method1()``: 

{{/text}}{{#code link="interfaces/somethingsareignored.html"}}
interface SomeThingsAreIgnored {
  /**
   * @hidden
   * this comment should be ignored
   * 
   */
  method1():Promise<void>;
  /**
   * this comment shouldn't be ignored
   */
  method2():string;
}
{{/code}}{{#text}}

The following example makes TypeDoc to ignore the whole class: 

{{/text}}{{#code link="classes/classtotallyignored.html"}}
/** @hidden */
export class ClassTotallyIgnored {
  color:string;
}
{{/code}}{{#text}}
